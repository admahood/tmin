This repository contains code for our night fires paper. 

## Overview

- `R/count-ts.R` fits binomial models for active fire detections for each ecoregion, and generates predictions across a range of VPD values
- `R/get-thresholds-and-plot-gam.R` computes VPD thresholds and visualizes the estimated VPD effects
- `R/case-study-ts.R` generates the case study time series supplemental plot of AF detections and VPD
